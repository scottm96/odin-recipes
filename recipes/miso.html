                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons white miso paste</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable stock base</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups cooked rice vermicelli noodles</li>
                <li>1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 cup thinly sliced baby bok choy</li>
            </ul><br>
        <h3>Steps</h3><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut tofu into 1/2-inch planks. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tofu, turning halfway through, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Cut tofu into cubes.</li>
                <li>Stir together green onions, miso paste, garlic, stock base, and ginger in a small bowl. Divide evenly among 3 microwave-safe pint-size canning jars with lids.</li>
                <li>Layer evenly with rice vermicelli noodles, tofu, mushrooms, and bok choy. Chill, covered, up to 5 days. To serve, see “Heat and Eat”. Garnish with sliced green onions.</li>
            </ol><br>
            <strong>Let jar stand at room temperature 10 minutes or run under warm water 1 minute. Add water (about 1 cup) to ingredients in jar until nearly full. Microwave without the lid for 3 minutes. Carefully screw on lid (jar will be very hot). Let stand 5 minutes. Invert jar to combine ingredients. Eat out of jar or transfer to a bowl to serve.</strong>
